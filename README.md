# Open_Street_Map_Cleaning-
Open Street Map is a type of software that is considered to be an example of volunteered geographical information. It currently has over 2 million registered users who contriubte to the Open Street Mapping foundation. With that many users the platform is prone to have many errors with the data that is being added to the software that so many people use. My task here is to take the data from a chosen area and clean it up! Make sure that words are not over abbreviated and that the data is clean and easy to read and utilize to be used in various applications such as FourSquare. Here is the step-by-step process for my data auditing and cleaning using Python and MongoDB.
